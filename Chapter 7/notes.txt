The getchar() function takes no arguments, and it returns the next character from input.
The putchar() function prints its argument.
These functions work with characters only.

C has a standard set of functions for analyzing characters. The ctype.h header file contains the prototypes. These functions take a character as an arguement and return nonzero (true) if the character belongs to a particular category and zero (false) otherwise.

An "else" goes with the most recent "if" unless braces indicate otherwise. Remember that the compiler ignores indentation.
