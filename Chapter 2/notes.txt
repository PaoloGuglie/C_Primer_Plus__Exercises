Functions are made up of statements.

The effect of #include <stdio.h> is the same as if I had typed the entire contents of the stdio.h file into my file at the point wher the #include line appears. Example of a C preprocessor directive. In general, C compilers oerform some preparatory work on source code before compiling; this is termed preprocessing.
C people call a collection of information that goes at the top of a file a header, and C implementations typically come with several header files.
For the most part, header files contain information used by the compiler to build the final executable program. But the actual code for a function is in a library file of precompiled code, not in a header file. The linker component of the compiler takes care fo finding the library code I need.

The semicolon at the end of the line identifies the line as a C STATEMENT or instuction. The semicolon is part of the statement.

The word "int" is a C keyword identifying one of the basic C data types.

The word "num" is an example of an IDENTIFIER, a name I select for a variable, a function...
The DECLARATION connects a particular identifier with a particular location in computer memory and it also establishes the type of information, or data type, to be stored at that location.
In C, all variables must be declared before they are used.

An ESCAPE SEQUENCE is used to represent difficult or impossible-to-type characters.

A PROTOTYPE declares to the compiler that you are using a particular function, so it's called a FUNCTION DECLARATION. When the compiler reached the point where butler() is used, it knows if it's used correctly.

The PROGRAM STATE is the set of values of all the variables at a given point in program execution.

A DEBUGGER is a program that enables me to run another program step-by-step and examine the value of that program's variables.
