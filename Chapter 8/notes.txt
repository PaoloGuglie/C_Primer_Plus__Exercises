getchar() and putchar() perfomr input and output one character at a time. This method does suit the capability of a computer. This approach is the heart of most programs that deal with text.

The immediate echoing of input characters is an instance of "unbuffered (or direct) input", meaning that the characters that I type are immediately made available to the waiting program. The delayed echoing, on the other hand, illustrates "buffered input", in which the characters I type are collected and stored in an area of temporary storage called a "buffer". Pressing enter "flushes" the buffer, making the characters available.
Buffered input is useful when correcting errors in text input.
Unbuffered input is useful in games.

Buffering comes in tow varieties: "fully buffered I/O" and "line-buffered I/O". For the fully buffered input, the buffer is flushed when it is full. With line-buffered I/O, the buffer is flushed whenever a newline character shows up. Keyboard input is normally line buffered, so that pressing Enter flushes the buffer.
